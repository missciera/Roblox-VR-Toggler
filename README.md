# About
If you wish to inspect the code, it's available in the Basefiles zip, you will have to have AutoHotKey installed to run the AHK file it contains, but the file can be opened in any text editor.

This program was made becuase i keep my VR headset plugged in most of the time, and i was tired of having to put it on to disable the option, since it turns itself on automatically.
