If you wish to inspect the code, it's available in the Basefiles zip, but if you want to run that version, you will have to have [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) installed, as well as [the TextFile library](https://github.com/hi5/TF).

This program was made becuase i keep my VR headset plugged in most of the time, and i was tired of having to put it on to disable the option, since it turns itself on automatically.
